    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am a huge fan of crockpot meals, especially this time of year.  I don’t know about you, but I am really busy during the holiday season.  The last thing I want to worry about is dinner.   This recipe is super easy and tastes great. Chicken slow-cooked in chicken gravy mix, cream of chicken soup, and chicken broth. Serve the shredded chicken over rice and dinner is done. I used Uncle Ben’s Ready Rice, and dinner was ready in less than 5 minutes after walking in the door!  Can’t beat that any time of year!</p>
